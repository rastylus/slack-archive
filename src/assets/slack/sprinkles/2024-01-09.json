Unfortunately it doesn’t look like the API directly imports the directions for the recipes, but it does import pictures, ingredients, and _links_, so I was thinking maybe we could pivot a bit and add the recipes to something like “favorites” or “special challenges”? Goes with the gamification theme?",
