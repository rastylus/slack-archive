    "text": ":bulb::dart::mega:.  Interview Advice Golden Nugget Incoming!!!!\n\nI'm going to put my HR manager hat back on and give you a few of my favorite interview questions.  Note, although some of these seem really silly, there is a purpose behind asking them.  I used to be responsible for hiring management staff where the logic and decision making rigors are very similar to what we deal with as a software dev.  Each of these questions is designed to glean real insights into the applicant's attitudes, abilities, decision making processes, motivation, etc.  These questions are designed to be conversation starters and create opportunities for meaningful interactions between the interviewer and applicant.\n\n_*Question 1: What makes you unique?*_\nCommon mistake: Getting too dazed to come up with a meaningful answer.\n_*What I want to see:*_ \nShow your unique selling points and self-awareness. You can do that by analyzing your skills, strengths, and previous achievements. Think about the industry and be specific about how you can contribute. The key is to be assertive, but not aggressive.  Confidence and professionalism are key.\n\n_*Question 2: If you were an animal, what animal would you be and why?*_\nCommon mistake: Naming your favorite animal or giving cliche answers like lion for leadership or dolphin for intelligence.\n_*What I'm looking for:*_ \nIdeally, pick an animal that represents important aspects of your personality but also ties back to the key competencies desirable in the role you’re interviewing for. It’s okay if you don’t know all the qualities of specific animals, just pick one that fits the competencies you want to highlight.\n\n_*Question 3: What was your best day at work?*_\nCommon mistake: Highlighting personal achievements only or picking a day when little work was done (like the Christmas party).\n_*What I want you say:*_\nYou need to find a balance between choosing a day that you enjoyed personally and one that shows professional value. Make sure your answer focuses on what motivates you, what makes you feel most fulfilled, and how your personal success helped company goals.\n\n_*Question 4: You’ve been given an elephant. You can’t give it away or sell it. What would you do with the elephant?*_\nCommon mistake: Not taking the question seriously or not knowing how to answer.\n_*What I'm looking for:*_\nWith this question, I'm trying to assess your adaptability, innovation, and problem-solving skills, so make sure your answer is both creative and highlights your approach to handling problems. An example answer could be: “I would use it to create a sanctuary and partner with local schools to raise awareness of extinction, conservation, and the importance of biodiversity”.\n\n_*Question 5: What two or three trends in our industry might disrupt our work, and how should we go about meeting these changes?*_\nCommon mistake: Not knowing much about the current industry trends or not mentioning any solutions to handle industry disruptions.\n_*What I want to see:*_\nI want to see you have deep industry knowledge, anticipation skills, and strategic thinking. Ideally, identify two key industry trends like AI, customer behavior changes or new competitor offerings), explain how they can impact the company, and propose strategic actions the company could take. Even though you're applying for an entry level role, demonstrating that you care enough to continue learning about your new industry can be a tremendous asset.\n \n_*Bonus tips:*_\nDon’t rush to answer immediately. It’s okay to take a moment to think.\nWhenever possible, connect your answer back to the job.\nEven if the question seems odd, show enthusiasm and be engaged.",
