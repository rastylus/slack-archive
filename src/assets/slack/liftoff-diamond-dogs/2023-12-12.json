They also have a plant FAQ that's free if we want to incorporate that too.\n\nIf we want hardiness we will have to pay for the $34/mo access. I wouldn't mind paying one or two months, but if we let the payment lapse and we want to show off this project later or whatever, that could possible break our site.\n\nHere's the free information we will be able to get from the API:\n1. Specific care information for each plant including sunlight, watering and pruning needs.\n2. Growth cycle (Perennial, Annual, etc) values of every plant and the ability to sort a list by growth cycle.\n3. Sorting a list of plants by sunlight needs.\n4. Sorting a list plants by watering needs.\n5. Photos of every plant.\nAny other response data from the API costs money. So we should decide if we need it in our app. I'm voting no just because I'm afraid it might break our app in the future if we stop paying for the premium api tier.",
