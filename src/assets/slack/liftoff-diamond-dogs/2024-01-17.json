I’ve also added file structure to add more custom events in the future. For tonight’s meeting NBVCXQ, I just want to make sure no one is encountering any issues in their local main branch that need resolving before demo tomorrow. We can talk more about demo tonight, but I can’t imagine that demos are going to take more than a couple minutes if we’re going to get through everyone tomorrow.",
