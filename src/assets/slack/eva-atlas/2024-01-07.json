I'll be driving back from my brother's house who lives about 3.5 hrs away, so I probably won't be home until around 10:30-11:00pm CT. Travel plans were kind of last minute, so apologies for the late cancel. I'll of course be in studio tomorrow and I have no plans to be out-of-town through the rest of January.\n\nIf you guys merge anything tonight, I'll merge the new main into my branch when I get home so it should be ready to merge back into main tomorrow evening during our studio time.",
