Reminder to keep your eyes peeled for your name if you will be interviewing tonight. \n\nThere is no attendance code for tonight, as this is just an interview/work day. I will have our main zoom with your breakout rooms opened at 5:30C/6:30E. \n\nAs always, I’ll be around all evening if you need any support. I think it would be a good idea if all groups at least briefly went over your project features to make sure everyone still hits the required 3 and to make sure things haven’t slipped through the cracks post-rescoping.
