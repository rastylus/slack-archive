Looks like you will have another TA looking at your project and possibly your code (plan to show your code and have it as organized as you can). I think you all have been doing well and have something to show. I would recommend focusing on having your application successfully running in your local environment. Also, make sure you are able to articulate your 3 features as well as the goal of the project you built with your group. Do your best to have your 3 features working, or at least to a state where they are close to working if you have been having issues.\nFor more details, check out the class announcements channel! Feel free to respond to this message if you have any questions.",
