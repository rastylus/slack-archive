I know it must be frustrating to have prepped and not get to go. Thank you to the few of you we were able to reschedule last minute. With so many moving parts and changes, I really appreciate everyone's patience.\n\nFor anyone who did not get to go:\n1. You will interview on January 15. \n2. If you need to retake after that, we will schedule with you (likely pulling you from a portion of class sometimes after Day 2).\nFor folks who did go:\n1. You will receive your scores in January. Anyone who scored less than a 4 on any category today will be notified prior to Interview Day 2. Hopefully, everyone who needs to retake will be able to on Day 2. However, we will prioritize based on volunteer availability in the following order: A) Folks who did not get to interview today B) Folks who did not score a 3 in at least one area C) Folks who did not score a 4 in at least one area and are aiming for the apprenticeship program. \n2. If you need to retake following Day 2, we will work on a schedule for those following that class.\n3. If you scored 4s or higher in all 3 categories, you may not hear from us regarding feedback until a little later as we prioritize the makeups. But you will receive that feedback as well. \nSend any questions you may have to Lexi, Colin, and myself, and we will get back to you when we are all back in office. Thanks everyone! Happy Holidays!",
