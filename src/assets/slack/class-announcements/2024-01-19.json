Anyone who did not demo yesterday or did not pass their demo will go on Monday after lecture. You will receive a link from a TA when they are ready for you. These will start at 6:30 central time until the end of class. \n3. We may also contact folks in class about makeup interviews depending on staff availability also starting at 6:30. Additional scheduling opportunities for makeup interviews will go out to folks today/Monday.\n4. We do still have lecture Monday and Thursday and everyone is expected to attend. Shaw from Talent Management will be there Monday, so bring your apprenticeship program questions to them. Then Shawn will cover Project Closeout. Thursday we are going over what to expect post-class and recommendations for next steps in your tech journey. \n5. We are working very hard to get all round 2 resume edits done today. Before I log off I will contact anyone who does not yet have edits on their resume if we do not get to everyone. If you do not have edits from me/Lexi or a message about it, please reach out on Monday but not before. \nHave a good weekend!",
