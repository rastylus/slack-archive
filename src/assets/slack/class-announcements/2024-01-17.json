Please review this \u003chttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1I6TRMfjSp6il4rPeJ1IudoINAh9PS2HpfKdJupdVLk0/edit?usp=sharing|Project Demo Learner Guide\u003e in preparation for Thursday. Just like for Project Checkpoints, you will be meeting with a TA for a different project group who will Slack you a link. *There is no lecture this Thursday, so demos will begin right at 5:30pm.* When not in your demo, you should be working on your Ready for Placement Survey (due Thursday), Professional Development Plan (due Monday), and your resume edits.\n\nFor your demo, you will be asked a series of questions under each of the three categories: Project Overview, Technical, and Professional. You'll also do a code walkthrough of your specific features, and each of your 3 features must be complete and working at the time of demo. *You will be required to share your screen while completing the code walkthrough.* Please have your project open before the demo begins to make sure that you are ready to go for the code walkthrough. This document shares with you the general idea of what questions you may be asked and a detailed rubric for each of the 3 scores you will receive.\n\nScores for demos will go up on Canvas early next week, and makeup instructions will also go out for those requiring makeups by Monday's class time. As general advice, if you feel your demo did not go well, be ready to go again Monday during class.\n\nThe front page of this document outlines a) items needed for graduation, b) items needed for apprenticeship, and c) what to expect when the class ends. *Please review carefully as those items are not negotiable.* \n\nUnrelated to demos, interview scores are going up in Canvas tomorrow. Those whose scores do not meet graduation requirements will receive their feedback tomorrow as well as instructions for scheduling their makeup. Those who do not meet apprenticeship pool requirements will receive their feedback by Monday as well as instructions for scheduling their makeup.\n\nFinally, stay tuned for more information about graduation, coming soon. :slightly_smiling_face:",
