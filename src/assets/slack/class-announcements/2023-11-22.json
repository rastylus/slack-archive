As a quick note, *please allow TAs to provide a link for your project in Github.* This may prevent future difficulties down the road. I also ask that while you are welcome to start working on project proposals, please do not submit until after Monday's lecture at the earliest. Shawn has a lot of great content planned that may affect your approach! However, Group Expectations are due Monday, and can be submitted at any time after the full group agrees if you have not already done so.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving for all who celebrate. See y'all next week!",
