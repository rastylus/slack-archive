If you *did not receive feedback* on your resume, then one of two things likely occurred:\n\n1. Your resume was not in the google doc format and we were therefore unable to leave comments directly.\n2. We did not have editing access granted to google docs and were therefore unable to leave comments.\nIf you have not received feedback yet, please first ensure that you have editing access enabled and that your resume is in proper template format!\n\nOk, that's it just wanted to make sure that everyone had the info in regards to their resume! See yall next year :coolblobrainbow:",
