We will be spending most of lecture time going over expectations, an intro to career readiness, and professional communication. You've likely noticed by now that Liftoff looks a little different from what you're used to. There isn't a textbook, and Canvas will be updated periodically throughout. Here are a few things to set you up for success:\n1. When you have Liftoff related questions, please direct them to both Colin and me. One of the two of us probably has the answer. :slightly_smiling_face: \n2. Project requirements, project proposal, and resume template are uploaded and available in Pages on Canvas now. Feel free to review. Graduation and Candidate requirements will be uploaded later today. We will be going over those requirements in class later today. \n3. You will be (if you haven't already) added to 2 new Slack channels, one for your project group and one with the other group(s) your TA is responsible for. Feel free to introduce yourself and get the convo going! You'll be working together closely for the next few months. \nMessage Colin and me with questions, or reply here.",
