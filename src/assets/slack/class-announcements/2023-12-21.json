    "text": "\u003c!channel\u003e Good morning and happy Interview Day! A few reminders/announcements heading into today:\n1. You should log into the regular lecture Zoom link promptly at 5:30. \u003c@U066ED0A4DU\u003e will lead a brief overview of the schedule and answer any questions you may have. \n2. Our interview start times are 6, 6:30, 7:15, and 7:45. Our goal is to let you know 10 minutes ahead of time when your round is up. We will be posting in this Slack Channel a list of people whose interviews are up. When your name is listed, log back into the lecture Zoom and we will get you moved to the appropriate breakout session for your interview. \n3. Each learner is scheduled for an interview. Please keep in mind that this event is only made possible because of volunteers. Sometimes our volunteers need to cancel last minute. If this is the case, some folks may not have an opportunity to interview today. If it is looking like someone will not get scheduled today, I will attempt to let them know prior to 7:15 tonight. These learners will be scheduled for Interview Day 2. \nRegarding Checkpoints:\n1. There are a few folks who scored a .5 and received a Slack message with instructions on how to rectify that by 5:30pm today. Please be sure to make those adjustments or you will be dropped from the course. \n2. There are a few folks who are redoing their Checkpoint today. You will receive further instruction on this process this afternoon. \n3. If you have a .5 or 0 in Canvas for your Checkpoint and did not receive a message from staff, please contact Colin, Lexi, and I as soon as possible. \n4. Drops will be finalized tonight.\n5. For groups with group members who are dropped, know that the next technical lecture and in-class activity will go over rescoping your project.\nMiscellaneous Announcements:\n1. Much of full-time LC staff are on PTO starting Friday, December 22 until Tuesday, January 2. Some of us are out the full time and some of us will be in and out with limited availability. You are welcome to still ask questions of course, but know you may not receive a response until January. Please be patient as we take time to recharge. \n2. When you message staff with questions, be sure you are including Lexi, Colin, and myself on those messages. \nFinally, I know interviews can be stressful for a lot of folks, but you've got this! Remember this is a low-risk environment to make mistakes, and that we have a second interview day baked into our schedule for a reason. Maybe you'll do better than you imagined and go into this break with newfound confidence. Maybe you'll stumble through, but you'll still leave with valuable feedback and another opportunity to try again in a few weeks. Either way, I know each of you will do your best, and that's all we ask for.\n\nFeel free to reply with encouraging comments, memes, gifs, other forms of motivation for your peers going into Interview Day tonight!",
