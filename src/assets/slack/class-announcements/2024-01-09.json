Submit your link in the Ready for Placement Survey, but you will have until 1/22 to finish. You will receive a grade for it on Canvas, but won't need to submit anything there for it.\n4. Interview Day 2 is January 15. If you had an interview on Day 1 and did not pass, you received a message from us earlier today. We are hopeful everyone who needs an interview of any kind on Monday will be scheduled, but we will prioritize by volunteer availability in the following order: people who have not yet had an interview, people who have not reached the threshold for graduation, and finally, people who have not reached the threshold for apprenticeship. \nI am also linking \u003chttps://launchcode.instructure.com/courses/86/pages/liftoff-class-overview|this page\u003e as a reminder that has the topics and due dates for all things Liftoff since there are a number of things that hit right at the end.",
