Staff will be reviewing resumes starting later this week, please continuously check your resume for those comments and address them as quickly as you can. The latest you can expect resume edits suggestions is 12/29. This round one of review focuses mostly on ensuring your formatting is solid. \n3. After you address your round 1 edits, I can go in and begin your second round edits. Right now, this is just being conducted by me, so please be patient. My goal is to have all second round reviews, focusing more on content, flow, grammar, etc. by 1/19. We will work on your resume together until we either get your resume officially approved at the level needed (graduation level or candidate pool level) or you hit the deadline for your level. \nI promise you, this is one area in which you want to be proactive. Often folks forget to prioritize their resume and its a dash up against deadlines. Working hard on it now will greatly benefit you later.",
