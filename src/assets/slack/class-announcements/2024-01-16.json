We hope to get scores up by the end of class on Thursday. We also will be notifying folks who did not pass with their feedback.\n2. We do not have any remaining scheduled interview days in class which means we need to get a little creative with how we do makeups. If you scored a 2 or lower or if you are on track for apprenticeship and scored a 3 or lower, you can expect to hear from us by the end of the day tomorrow with plans for makeups. Please stay vigilant on Slack as one of the options we are looking at is during the day on Thursday for folks with daytime availability.\n3. Project demos are on Thursday! We will be post a guide for this later today. They will largely feel like Project Demos. You will be messaged by a TA to conduct your demo. You will be asked a series of questions and should be prepared to share your code. You'll be asked about your features, the project as a whole, and your experience working in a group project.\n4. I know some of you may not feel ready. Please make your absolute best effort to be prepared for demo on Thursday. We will allow for makeups next week, but want everyone to go through the review on Thursday.\n5. \u003c@U066ED0A4DU\u003e and I are still making our way through round 2 resume reviews. Thank you for your patience as the two of us spend time with each of your documents individually. We will have edits for you by Friday. Please correct those as soon as possible afterwards.\n6. We will also be sending out graduation related announcements later this week, so stay tuned!\nWe are almost at the end, folks! Keep going. You've got this!",
