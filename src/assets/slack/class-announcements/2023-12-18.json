So please read through this whole message and post your questions as you have them here!\n\n1. Starting at 6pm, you may receive a Slack message from a course staff member with a link to your Checkpoint. Please click into the link as soon as possible to be respectful of everyone’s time. Your Checkpoint should be around 10 minutes or less. Staff are encouraged to only wait about a minute, so please keep an eye on your Slack. If you miss part of lecture, please view the recording posted later tonight.\n\n2. The staff person conducting your checkpoint will go down a list of questions with you and will ask to view your code, so please be ready. As a reminder, here’s the \u003chttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1T7AUIr-j_tV_tsXq2VWCFuxbYx8hDV1JDaww4xr7M6c/edit#heading=h.dspie2m6cz70|Checkpoint/Mid-Unit Drop Guide \u003efor more context on what to expect.\n\n3. Staff are instructed not to share scores in real-time. Instead, they are filling out forms to be confirmed by LC staff and submitting grades to Canvas. In Canvas, 1 is pass, 0 is not pass, .5 requires follow-up.\n\n4. If you have any questions throughout the class, message Lexi, Melinda, AND Colin so we can address it quickly.\n\nIf you do not pass your checkpoint or do not have a submitted resume link by end of class tonight, you will be dropped by the end of the week. If we do not get through all learner checkpoints today, you will be contacted by staff regarding a rescheduled checkpoint prior to the end of the week.\n\nGood luck everyone! Take a moment tonight to be proud of how far you’ve come!",
