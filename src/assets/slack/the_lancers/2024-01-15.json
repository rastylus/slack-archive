    "text": "Hey Cory, I see that the API exercises are being saved into my sequel, and that the page the user gets sent to upon clicking, \"save exercise\" is workouts/create. And the selected API exercises show up as an option under exercises there, but after that it runs into an error, do I have this right? Also, I'm guessing there's some sort of duplication prevention in my sequel because I see the search exercises all get saved no matter if the user selected them or not which I don't think is a big deal considering the low amount of data plane text takes up. I think there might be a conflict with the routing that gets sent to workouts/create because the user created exercises aren't showing up along with the selected API exercises. I am going to look at fixing that right now! I will be doing my best to get a clean version of the project before Wednesday because I think our final demo is on Thursday.",
