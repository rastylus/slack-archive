The student and tutor login code is now in the login controller so there is only one link for both types of logins, also the added login repository is what sets the roles for students and tutors in the login table.

I tried via the authcontrollers where the new record is being created (line 94) but there kept being issues.  I need you to get the enum to populate in sql.\nTried to get the calendar to display on the tutor profile, working on that/filling in the rest of the profiles and the nav bars tomorrow.
