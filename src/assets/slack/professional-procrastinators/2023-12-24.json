I added a basic navbar (we can make it pretty once it gets added to the development branch) as well as the basic functionality of an \"add vacation\" form. For the index page, I have each entry being added into a table for now and we can update that once we get a little further along with getting the database set up (I think the idea was for a dashboard to populate with vacation data when a vacation is selected from the dropdown). Is anyone else making edits right now, or is it okay for me to start a pull request to the development branch? I pushed my code if anyone wants to review it first",
