I cannot speak for JP regarding his flashcards feature, but given that the original code was working as intended, I would like to keep the original code without these changes if it is okay with you all. I am saying this because I will feel a lot more comfortable explaining the actual code I wrote on my edit flashcards and user comments features during demo next Thursday. Of course, I do think you can use this PR branch (charu-newtesting) to show the functionality of our entire app next Thursday to your assigned TA.
