In Fact, this is not my first time Applying for LaunchCode , but i had to keep on Trying and pushing.\nI am currently working in the Optical Field as an inspector, Another way to challenge Myself and Learn something completely new and different. I like learning New Skills from scratch, Grow and become the best version of myself everyday.\nSince May 2023 I have join the Full Stack Web development Program again, we have learned technologies such as JavaScript along with React, Java for the backend along with Springboot and Thymeleaf. We have also used MySql to manage the Database.\n My Team and I have decided to work on a Customer Relationship Management Application(CRM). Starting this Project from scratch can be intimidating , but with all the tools and knowledge we acquire from day one of class, i firmly believe this will be a great Opportunity to Sharpen my Skills. In my next career, as a mentioned before, i wish to continue growing, learning more and contribute as much as i could in the tech Industry to uplift others as well.",

In Fact, this is not my first time Applying for LaunchCode , but i had to keep on Trying and pushing.\nI am currently working in the Optical Field as an inspector, Another way to challenge Myself and Learn something completely new and different. I like learning New Skills from scratch, Grow and become the best version of myself everyday.\nSince May 2023 I have join the Full Stack Web development Program again, we have learned technologies such as JavaScript along with React, Java for the backend along with Springboot and Thymeleaf. We have also used MySql to manage the Database.\n My Team and I have decided to work on a Customer Relationship Management Application(CRM). Starting this Project from scratch can be intimidating , but with all the tools and knowledge we acquire from day one of class, i firmly believe this will be a great Opportunity to Sharpen my Skills. In my next career, as a mentioned before, i wish to continue growing, learning more and contribute as much as i could in the tech Industry to uplift others as well."
